In last recipe we learned how to use future with Actor, In this recipe we would know how to use Future inside the actor.

Getting Ready
All the prerequsites are same as before, just import Helo-Akka project.

How to do it..
1. Create a file say FutureInsideActor.scala in package com.packt.chapter4
2. Add below imorts to the top of the file.
import akka.actor.{Props, ActorSystem, Actor}
import scala.concurrent.{Await, Future}
import scala.concurrent.duration._
3.Create an actor which uses a future inside.

class FutureActor extends Actor {
  import context.dispatcher
  def receive = {
    case (a:Int, b:Int) => val f = Future(a+b)
      println(Await.result(f, 10 seconds))
  }
}
4. Create a test application as below.
  object FutureInsideActor extends App {

  val actorSystem = ActorSystem("Hello-Akka")

  val fActor = actorSystem.actorOf(Props[FutureActor])

  fActor !(10, 20)

}

How it works.
